# Webdev links mini page

- A small example react progam with parallax effect.
- It reads the content of "content.md" in my repository
  so make sure you change the link in LinkList.jsx to display another markdown file. The markdown file is
  not read from the deployment, but from repo, so its enough to change the content in the repo (or wherever
  the site loads the content from ) to update the page, no need to redeploy to update.

### how to run

clone the repo, and make sure you change the link in LinkList.jsx
then run:

```
npm install
npm dev
```
